# Stylish CSS Framework

## Demo

## Why?

After using several different CSS frameworks, I realized that none of them truly work the way I want them to. Margins and padding were just not right or even worse, I'd implement version X and then version Y would come out, completly changing how the framework works. This, in turn, required tons of re-work to update to the new version.

# TODO

- Implement versioning/build numbers
